Title: Simpleplanner

Vision: We simply want to offer an application for everyone that allows members to coordinate an event without the hassle of having to create an entire social networking account.

Automated Tests: We made the tests with a program called TestComplete. You can start a free trial here: https://smartbear.com/product/testcomplete/overview/. Once the software is installed, open the project attached and go to advanced->script and then you should see Unit1, Unit2, Unit 3 in the left hand menu. Open each and click the play button with the lines behind it in the top left corner above the script. This will start the automated walkthrough on your computer.

There are 3 features currently being tested using this automated method: create event, log in, and sign up. 
Here is an in progress screenshot of the sign up automation running:

User Acceptance Tests: 
The beta-test users can test 3 main functionalities of the website: signing up/logging in, creating a new event,and the general functionality of the home page. The user will try these in a normal webpage layout as well as on a mobile device. There will be multiple users to test this so as to get the full use out of the website to have events and groups with multiple users. They would give us back a detailed report on their results and any ideas for fixes or improvements.
Signing Up and Logging In: The user will attempt to create an account and try many types of names, emails, and passwords to make sure it only accepts valid forms. From there, they will make sure that they can log in correctly using the login page and that it accepts the account previously made. The user will then use other functionality to ensure that it keeps them logged in and able to see all events relative to them on the homepage and that the account page displays their correct information.
Creating a New Event: The user will attempt to create a new event and try different types of input for title, start/end times, location, tags, etc. From there, they will make sure that they are tied to it as the host and verify that the data they input shows up correctly on the event cards. They will also test to make sure that private events only show up on the page for those invited to it.
Home Page Functionality: The user will test all functionality of the home page. They will verify that all buttons work and display the correct information after clicked. They will verify that the event cards section only shows relevant events to them and that they are displayed properly. The user will also verify that the map correctly shows the relevant events.
